          <h3>
Your friendship is true,
you're always there for me when i'm down or blue.

Dancing around, singing in the rain,
and all of the friendship we've yet to gain.

So many years spent together,
I will never forget them, never, ever.

The long road ahead is looking bright,
and everyone knows we'll put up a fight.

You're the missing piece to my shattered heart,
and it hurts that we live so far apart.

Our friendship is now stronger than ever,
we've been through so many hard times together.

We've changed and grew up in different places,
but it's all good, we know that nobody will ever replace us.

I haven't seen you in a while,
i miss seeing that warm sweet smile.

Our friendship will remain true,
and you'll always be the one i call when i'm down or blue.
</h3>
